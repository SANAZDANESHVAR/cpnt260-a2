1.	I used vs cod and then put all the css staff in style.
2.	I defined a container as whole part of project then a card which  shows a river picture
3.	The info class is about heading and paragraph
4.	Universal body tag define ratio
5.	Fab class is for showing the icons staff  
6.	Define circle with background of joy then arrange it with margin in correct place 
7.	Footer is consider as box to show correctly 
8.	The background color and the border of joeâ€™s picture are similar
 I hope you can follow my writing. 
thank you
